- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.17.0 is recommended for this repo)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (manage multiple versions of Node and NPM)

## Setup
```
$ npm run setup
```
When running setup you will be prompted to enter information regarding your project.

## Running
```
$ npm run start 
```

## Build

When building the final project and template for deployment run:
```
$ npm run build
```

To add a report analyzing the javascript bundle run:

$ npm run build:analyze
```

This will create a build folder with html, javascript and css files along with an assets folder.
